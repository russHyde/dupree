# dupree 0.2.0

* lintr dependence pinned to lintr=2.0.0 so that non-R-codeblocks and empty R
markdown files can be dealt with cleanly

* Tests that depend on `stringdist::seq_sim` were rewritten to ensure they
consistently pass

* Dependency on deprecated dplyr verbs removed

* Code to prevent double-reporting of code-block pairs was
initiated by @Alanocallaghan

# dupree 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
